If there is a color change then you will need to view it in the splitter, add it and then you will physically change the color of filament when ready. This was similar to things I have done in the past because I have had experience with editing the dimensions of objects in a CAM software. However, it was very different because I got to be creative with my color change and where it did to make my name tag a bit more than just 2 colors.

At first glance it might not look like there is much information to gain, however the stringing on the cat is likely due to extra filament leaking from the extruder as it prints. This means that incredible details might be lost because extra filament might leak and consequently muddying the details. Furthermore there might be issues with speed because if the extruder is leaking, if it is moving faster it could likely mess up entire prints. </p>

                                        <p class="mb-3 text-white-50">My goal throughout this entire process was to simply enjoy the Art of Creation and in that way I have succeeded. Every situation, feeling, or person should be honored but nothing truly matters and in that way all things can be used, not as a matter of ownership but rather use through the surrender of what is. Holding on to expectations creates problems where there don’t need to be, instead I live and create by valuing everything and using what is, to foster new growth rather than wishing what could’ve been, to be. For my workflow for this process I started off with rough measurements of my PS5 controller. I wanted to make a headphone and controller stand that used the weight of both to stay upright. The problem I had with many of the stands that I have been using, is that they often fall over because of the weight of either the controller or the headset. My idea puts the 2 of them to make sure that this doesn’t happen, without making many more work on the manufacturing end. 

I used both TinkerCAD and Fusion to try to execute my idea and found that while Fusion is more complex it is more equipped for making more complex designs. For this reason I preferred using Fusion for this project because I could be precise with my measurements. However, I found that while this complexity can be a benefit in some cases, it was less than ideal when moving designs from CAD to CAM . For example, all of my parts were too big to fit on the Prusa MINI print bed, so the software allowed me to scale the sizes. Consequently, the new measurements on the bed were not anything like my original measurements and some things printed much smaller than the 95% size decrease I thought was applied to the new design. When it came time to assemble the parts nothing would fit together because of this.

If I wanted to improve this further in the future, I think my first step would be to use a larger printer. Most of the design “issues” that I happened to face had little to do with the entire design process and just with the size of the printer relative to the idea I had in my head. That being said this prototype was successful in that it taught me a lot about the process and ways I can improve despite it not being able to be put together.
